How much [space to leave to the closest viewport edge](https://unpoly.com/scroll-tuning#revealing-with-padding) when scrolling to an element.

To leave space between a [revealed](https://unpoly.com/up.reveal) element and the closest viewport edge, pass a pixel value as `{ revealPadding }` option.

The default is `{ revealPadding: 0 }`.
You may change this default in `up.viewport.config.revealPadding`.
