Specifies behavior if the [target selector](https://unpoly.com/up.render#options.target) is missing from the current page or the server response.

If set to a CSS selector, Unpoly will attempt to replace that selector instead.

If set to `true` Unpoly will attempt to replace a [main target](https://unpoly.com/up-main) instead.

If set to `false` Unpoly will immediately reject the render promise.
