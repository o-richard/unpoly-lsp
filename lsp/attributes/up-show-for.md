Only shows this element if an input field with `[up-switch]` has one of the given values.

See `[up-switch]` for more documentation and examples.

Multiple values can be separated by either a space (`foo bar`) or a comma (`foo, bar`).
If your values might contain spaces, you may also serialize them as a JSON array (`["foo", "bar"]`).
