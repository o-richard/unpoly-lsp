A message the user needs to confirm before fragments are updated or before the layer is closed.

The message will be shown as a [native browser prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt).

If the user does not confirm the render promise will reject and no fragments will be updated.
