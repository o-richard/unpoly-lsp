The [target selector](https://unpoly.com/targeting-fragments) to update after a [failed response](https://unpoly.com/failed-responses).

See [Rendering failed responses differently](https://unpoly.com/failed-responses#rendering-failed-responses-differently) for details.

If omitted, a failed response will *not* update the [`[up-target]`](#up-target), but update the [main target](https://unpoly.com/up-main) instead. In forms, it defaults to the form element itself.
