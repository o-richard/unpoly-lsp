⚠️ [DEPRECIATED - use `up-dismiss`] When this element is clicked, closes a currently open overlay.

Does nothing if no overlay is currently open.

To make a link that closes the current overlay, but follows to a fallback destination on the root layer:

```html
<a href="/fallback" up-close>Okay</a>
```
