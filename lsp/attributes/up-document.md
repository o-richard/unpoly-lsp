A string of HTML containing the targeted fragment.

See [Extracting an element's outer HTML from a larger HTML string](https://unpoly.com/providing-html#document).

Instead of passing an HTML string you can also [pass a template selector](https://unpoly.com/templates),
optionally with [variables](https://unpoly.com/placeholders#dynamic-templates).
